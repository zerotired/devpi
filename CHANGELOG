0.8.3
----------------

- use pip's link parser rather than beautifulsoup
  to benefit from link parsing code tested out 
  and maintained in the wild.  Adapt README.

- skip a test if crontab command is not present
  (thanks Markus Zapke-Gruendemann)

0.8.2
------------------------------

- fix issue6 - some edge cases for link parsing uncovered
  by BeautifulSoup and CouchApp installs. Thanks Anton Baklanov.

- fix issue5 - require minimal versions for deps, thanks Andi Albrecht

- remove superflous include lines in MANIFEST.in


0.8.1
------------------------------

- fix: change gendeployed supervisord.conf  to not autostart
  processes on "devpi-ctl" invocations.  "devpi-ctl help"
  would autostart the processes after a shutdown which is
  not very intuitive.  This is actually compatible with the 
  documentation.

- refactor --gendeploy related code to be in gendeploy.py

- fix: fixate path of devpi-server in gendeployed configuration
  to point to the freshly installed devpi-server. also add
  a note to the README.

0.8
------------------------------

- introduce "--gendeploy=TARGETDIR" for generating a virtualenv
  directory with supervisor-based configuration in TARGETDIR/etc
  and a TARGETDIR/bin/devpi-ctl helper to control the running
  of devpi-server and redis-server processes.

- fix issue4: keep the "changelog" thread active across
  network/reachability errors.  Thanks Laurent Brack.

- use argparse instead of optparse, simplify and group options

- fix python2.6 and simplify logging configuration
