0.8.1
------------------------------

- fix: change gendeployed supervisord.conf  to not autostart
  processes on "devpi-ctl" invocations.  "devpi-ctl help"
  would autostart the processes after a shutdown which is
  not very intuitive.  This is actually compatible with the 
  documentation.

- refactor --gendeploy related code to be in gendeploy.py

- fix: fixate path of devpi-server in gendeployed configuration
  to point to the freshly installed devpi-server

0.8
------------------------------

- introduce "--gendeploy=TARGETDIR" for generating a virtualenv
  directory with supervisor-based configuration in TARGETDIR/etc
  and a TARGETDIR/bin/devpi-ctl helper to control the running
  of devpi-server and redis-server processes.

- fix issue4: keep the "changelog" thread active across
  network/reachability errors.  Thanks Laurent Brack.

- use argparse instead of optparse, simplify and group options

- fix python2.6 and simplify logging configuration
